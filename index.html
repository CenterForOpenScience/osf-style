                            <h4 id="app_state" class="f-w-md"><a></a>Let the user know about state where applicable</h4>
                            <p>When a state change in the UI is happening the user should be notified of some of these processes where it helps the user understand what's going on and differentiate the situation from a potential unresponsive or erroneous scenario.</p>
                            <p>Some examples:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Items that are actionable need to be visually distinct (i.e. links, buttons, draggable items)</li>
                                <li>Pending processes should be identified if taking long</li>
                                <li>When page loads if there are still asynchronous components loading, a loading indicator needs to make that clear</li>
                                <li>Normally actionable items that are non-actionable should be muted (greyed out)</li>
                                <li>Tooltips should be used to explain states that do not otherwise make sense</li>
                                <li>Actionable items should be protected against multiple hits (i.e. Delete buttons turning to muted Deleting...)</li>
                                <li>If using active states, the active component needs to be visually distinc, for instance in buttons, panels, tabs.</li>
                                <li>Toggle buttons should change to reflect the current state. For instance a collapsed item should have an icon that suggests opening and that icon should change when the state needs to suggest closing.</li>
                                <li>Utilize the <strong>cursor</strong> attribute of CSS to change cursors on hover but only when this change makes sense (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor</a>)
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>default</strong> is for general purpose</li>
                                        <li><strong>pointer</strong> is for links and items that are clickable</li>
                                        <li><strong>move</strong> is for items that can be moved with drag already</li>
                                        <li><strong>row/col-resize</strong> To drag and resize horizontal or vertical items, content.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 id="errors" class="f-w-md"><a ></a>Let the user know about errors and offer alternatives where possible</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes user driven or connectivity based errors halt or make certain UI actions possible. The interface should provide alternatives and information</p>
                            <p>Example with space limitation :</p>
                            <div class="osf-box box-lt p-lg">

                            <p>Example:</p>

                            <p>To the extent possible all our components should be using the exact same styling by using the OSF Style Guidelines. This means:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Buttons should look exactly the same in style, with color differences denoting similar meaning</li>
                                <li>Color palette should be used in similar ways; (e.g. we should have a single highlight background color for all hover effects)</li>
                                <li>Element use for common tasks should be the same. I.e. different sections within pages should not use tabs in one place and accordion menus in others if the target elements are exactly the same.</li>
                                <li>Different icons should not be used to mean the same thing and one icon should not be used for multiple meanings. Icon association should make sense to the task</li>
                                <li>Responsive components should become responsive in similar ways. For instance if icons lose their labels in small views, that should be the case with all icons.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr>
                            <h4 id="empty_space" class="f-w-md"><a ></a>Utilize empty space with actionable suggestions</h4>
                            <p>There are many areas where users don't have content available. In these cases their pages or elements will be empty. We can use these isntances to offer actionable tasks with appropriate links.</p>
                            <p>Example:</p>
                            <div class="osf-box box-lt p-lg">

                            <h4 id="form_inputs" class="f-w-md"><a ></a>Improve the form input and toggle process where possible</h4>
                            <p>Follow these guidelines when making forms or add elements such as drop downs.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If your dropdown has few elements, consider another input or toggle method, like a button group.</li>
                                <li>Alphabetically organize your dropdowns</li>
                                <li>Make input elements large and text visible</li>
                                <li>Uniformity in input elements is important, stick to themes or frameworks; if you are adding custom css to established framework css for inputs you are most likely doing it wrong.</li>
                                <li>Do not remove the visual separation of focus on input elements, but make it fit to your general theme.</li>
                                <li>Most of the time select and checkbox items are too small, consider increasing their size or generally make sure they fill your font's line height</li>
                                <li>Make sure tab goes to the next item if there is a form with multiple items</li>
                                <li>If usign JS for form inputs, bind Enter key.</li>
                                <li>Don't have a "Clear Form" button.</li>
                                <li>Avoid using too many borders in form structures. Alignment is a way to denote edges as well and inputs already have borders.</li>
                                <li>Use a good combination of placeholder and label for inputs, often one is enough, both are unnecessary. Don't repeat the label in the placeholder. Label is better for cross browser use.</li>
                                <li>Tie your labels to your form elements with "for" so that when users click on the label the input gets selection.</li>

                            <p>If you are using a single page approach where page loads are not required for significant events remember that users consider significant layout changes to denote page changes and will want to press back to go back to the previous state.</p>
                            <p>Make sure that your implementation takes care of these two issues.</p>

                            <p>There are times where these general practices may not make sense for rare isntances. In those cases it is better UI practice to abandon convention and use custom solutions. These cases should be few and should require discussion.</p>

                                <li>Grid columns need to add up to 12.</li>
                                <li>Each total of 12 should be inside its own "row" div.</li>
                                <li>Plan out the layout of your component on paper before you start coding and then write the html code of the row structure first. This will alleviate the problem of columns not matching up or some div tags not closing.</li>
                                <li>Bootstrap grid is designed to fit columns together, if there is an unnecessary amount of space in between components, first check that your grid is properly built.</li>
                                <li>Bootstrap grids do not align heights of columns. If you need column heights to be equal you will need to manually set them or use other libraries.</li>
                                <li>Do not use grids to center align a component horizontally unless there is no other semantically meaningful way to do so.</li>

                        <h4 class="m-t-lg">Guidelines for Button Text</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not use OK, even if it makes sense with the question being asked. People skim to the button often and OK doesn't help understand the meaning quickly. </li>
                            <li>Buttons should have verbs and should start with verbs. i.e. "Make Public" instead of "Public" alone or "Visibility Setting" </li>
                            <li> The button does not need to repeat the header. I.e "Add" is enough for the submit button for a modal that says "Add Contributors".</li>
                            <li> Be deliberate in your use of Cancel vs Close. Cancel is supposed to undo any potential change visually or with data or denote change of intention by the user (i.e. Don't save). Close simply removes an element from view. Modals need a Close button and forms need a Cancel button. If the form has brought the user to a different page Cancel should bring them back to where they were. </li>
                            <li> Don't abandon Cancel or Close buttons next to Save in favor of Dismiss buttons (x at the top right of content). Cancel is easier to find and click and the X button is conventional, both are useful. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Form buttons</h4>
                        <p>With forms don't use Submit. Use the word that the activity requires. </p>
